# Features!

 Page constitutes a Javascript query form.

 # How to use it:

 - Input triangle dimensions into A B and C side fields.
 - Letters A B and C represents the three sides of a triangle.
 - Click SUBMIT
 - Once submitted an alert with the Triangle type appears .

 # User
 - The user needs to know if the dimensions they have will make a perfect
 triangle and if so will it fall as Equilateral, Isosceles or Scalene triangle.

 # Js
 
 - Javascript pics values input from the user.
 - A form is created on .html page with Sides a,b, and c for the user.
 - A link is made between Javascript and HTML to pick the input values, parse
 them to Intergers and perform the "triangle" function.

 # function
 - The function checks if the sum of any two sides is greater than the value of
 the third side, if this condition is met then the dimensions qualifies as
 a triangle hence gets to second stage of checking the type of triangle, if this
 condition is not met an alert of Not a "valid triangle" is generated.

 - Asuming it is a valid triangle (the above condition is met), the program
 checks if it has equal sides (Equilateral Triangle) or only two sides are equal
 (Isosceles triangle) and if the two conditions are not met then it is Scalene
 triangle.
